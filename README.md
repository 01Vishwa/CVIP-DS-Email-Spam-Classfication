# Email-Spam-Classfication
The Email Spam Classification Project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham). This project explores various algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Decision Tree to determine the most effective model for classifying emails.

**Algorithms Used:**
1. **Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors.
2.** Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees to improve the predictive accuracy and control overfitting.
3. **Logistic Regression:** A regression analysis used for predicting the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function.
4. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC):** A supervised learning algorithm that separates data into classes by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between them.
5. **Decision Tree:** A flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

   **Accuracy of Models**
